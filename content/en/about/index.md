_Le Mercure Galant_ [Gallant Mercury], a literary periodical and gazette founded in 1672 by Jean Donneau de Visé (1638-1710), is one of the most important French cultural artifacts of the turn of the eighteenth century. Not only did its monthly issues keep the literate population informed about the latest news, gossip, fashion, art, etiquette, music, literature, and scientific discoveries, it also gave its readers the opportunity to weigh in as contributors—submitting sheet music, poems, riddles, short stories, and other newsworthy novelties, along with letters that outlined their perspectives on topics ranging from aesthetics and culture to philosophy and physics.
