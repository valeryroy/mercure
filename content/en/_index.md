Our digital, bilingual anthology is a collaborative project which will focus on fifteen of the 373 stories that were published during Donneau de Visé’s years at the periodical’s helm (1672-1710). Our general introduction will provide an overview of the Mercure and the society it describes, the periodical’s history and its significance.
