## Synopsis

From 1672 to 1710, editor in chief Jean Donneau de Visé published 488 in-12 volumes of the Le Mercure Galant, **one of the most important French cultural artifacts of the turn of the 18th century**. This pioneering publication combined news, entertainment, and pro-Louis XIV propaganda, while covering a vast range of topics, from science and philosophy to military affairs, from court celebrations to the arts and fashion. Some of its reader-centered innovations, such the publication of letters to the editor and puzzle contests, are still standard fare in modern newspapers and magazines. Alongside the reports on current events, the Mercure also featured poetry, fables, and nouvelles--short stories presented as fact, with contemporary settings and characters.
        
        Our proposed digital bilingual critical anthology will focus on
        twenty of the nearly four hundred nouvelles that were published
        during Donneau de Visé’s years at the Mercure’s helm (1672-1710).
        The pieces in this small but representative selection have been
        chosen for their literary quality, their entertainment value, and
        the insight they provide into some of the century’s most salient
        and pressing social, political, and intellectual topics.
        They shed light on diverse aspects of 17th-century French culture,
        including attitudes about race, class, gender normativity, women’s
        status, religion, medicine, magical thinking, and the power of the
        imagination to alter the material conditions of the body.
        Each story in our anthology will be translated from French into
        English, thoroughly annotated, and preceded by a critical
        introduction that situates the story in its cultural and historical
        context. As an open-access digital publication, it will be available
        to researchers worldwide. We expect it will interest scholars of Race,
        Ethnicity and Gender, the History of Medicine, Women’s Studies,
        Religious Studies, Philosophy, Economics, and European Literary
        History. It will also provide important primary sources for the
        study of European intellectual, social, and cultural history.
